# Brown Representability Notes
These notes were created as a supplement to my lecture on Brown Representability given in our Math 509 - Homological Algebra class in Spring 2019.

They give a basic rundown of the categorical background required followed by some motivation of the idea behind Brown representability and a discussion of it in the context of (infinity,1)-categories and stable homotopy theory before finally culminating in a presentation of Neeman's generalization to triangulated categories.

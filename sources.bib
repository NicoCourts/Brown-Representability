abstract = {The first two chapters of this book offer a modern, self-contained exposition of the elementary theory of triangulated categories and their quotients. The simple, elegant presentation of these known results makes these chapters eminently suitable as a text for graduate students. The remainder of the book is devoted to new research, providing, among other material, some remarkable improvements on Brown''s classical representability theorem. In addition, the author introduces a class of triangulated categories""--the ""well generated triangulated categories""--and studies their properties. This},

abstract = {Grothendieck proved that if is a proper morphism of nice schemes, then has a right adjoint, which is given as tensor product with the relative canonical bundle. The original proof was by patching local data. Deligne proved the existence of the adjoint by a global argument, and Verdier showed that this global adjoint may be computed locally. In this article we show that the existence of the adjoint is an immediate consequence of Brown's representability theorem. 1It follows almost as immediately, by ``smashing'' arguments, that the adjoint is given by tensor product with a dualising complex. Verdier's base change theorem is an easy consequence.},
